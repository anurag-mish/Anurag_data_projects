# Movie Ratings Recommendation Project 🎬

This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)-based collaborative filtering model to recommend movies based on user similarity. The analysis is done using PySpark on Google Colab and data pulled from Google Cloud Platform (GCP) storage.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- PySpark
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- Pearson Correlation Coefficient

## 📊 Project Highlights
- Uploaded large-scale user rating data to GCP and accessed it via PySpark on Colab.
- Cleaned and transformed user data using Python dictionaries and pandas.
- Computed similarity between users using Pearson correlation to build a recommender.
- Filtered recommendations using statistical significance (p < 0.05).
- Extracted key behavior patterns and preference trends.
